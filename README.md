# MotionMaker

This program creates legal motions from user input. The motions are created in Microsoft Word Documents with preselected formatting. The program can store an attorney's profile
for signature blocks. This profile can include name, phone, firm information, and address. 

Once a user inputs a case number, the program will automatically retrieve case information such as attorney information, parties, and case name. With another button press
the motion will populate with the information retrieved. Currently only works for data from Galveston County, TX public criminal records.

Program is a very rough draft and is continued to being improved upon.
